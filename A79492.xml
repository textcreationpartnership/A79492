            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And his malice is principally bent again≈øt tho≈øe who are mo≈øt con≈øcientious and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the eyes of the Lord, as may appear in the ≈øtory
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117368:4"/>of holy <hi>Job,</hi> who was greatly afflicted on every ≈øide, both in his Per≈øon, Name and E≈øtate, but in due time God vindicated his reputation before all men, and did ble≈ø≈øe his latter end more then his beginning, and ≈øo if we mark the end of ≈øuch perfect and upright per≈øons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it is peace, but <hi>the wicked is like the raging Sea foa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out mire and dirt,</hi> meer mire and dirt; ≈øomewhat like to the dirty Pamphlet of <hi>David Brown</hi> the Scotti≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the Fronti≈ø-peece whereof, ≈øeemeth to in≈øinuate to the ≈øimple hone≈øt Reader, as if LIEUT. COL. <hi>JOHN LILBORNE,</hi> my ≈øelfe, and Mr. <hi>Mu≈øgrave</hi> were prodigious Con≈øpirators, and bloody Petitioners, but he that reads the Pamphlet may perceive that he hath no ≈øuch thing again≈øt us, ble≈ø≈øed be God: But the ≈øum of it is, A remembrance to put the Parliament in mind of the di≈øcovery which he made of a Malignant Petition, wherein he complaineth that he was not rewarded for the ≈øaid Di≈øcovery, and ≈øtileth him≈øelfe and his Family, the <hi>Parliaments Remembrancers,</hi> ≈øo his whole Petitiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Remon≈øtrance is a begging bu≈øine≈ø≈øe for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and protection from Arre≈øts.</p>
            <p>Surely he thought that now, now was the time for him to ≈øtrike while the iron was hot, and that now the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament were nece≈ø≈øitated to hear and receive his coun≈øel and to regard him, and reward him, ≈øeeing he had taken upon him now, in the heat of all the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe to be their Advocate, and to plead their cau≈øe again≈øt poor <hi>Lilborne</hi> who was down, and therefore according to the Proverb, <hi>downe with him,</hi> but its well that neither the Parliament nor Sir <hi>Arthur He≈øilrige</hi> ≈øtand in need of the untempered morter, of ≈øuch unskilfull Daubers, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Bulwarks again≈øt the Levellers, I hope rather then they will countenance ≈øuch revengefull ≈øpirits, they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117368:4"/>will feed their Enemy when he is hungry, and give him drink when he is thir≈øty; for the Parliament of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves are very milde to their Enemies, if not provoked again≈øt them by ≈øome others.</p>
            <p>It may be that this Pamphleteir thought that rather then he would want worke, he would ≈øet him≈øelfe on work, if the Devill will find him tooles: but as Chri≈øt would not have ≈øuch Advocates to confe≈ø≈øe that he was the Son of God, but commanded the Devills to hold their peace; So its better for the Parliament to ≈øilence ≈øuch Babblers, then to ≈øuffer them≈øelves to be ≈øo di≈øgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, by having their prai≈øe ≈øet forth in ≈øcurrillous Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plets, ≈øuch as this Authours, who not knowing which way to be revenged of me, for doing my duty in the Church of which I am (and he was) a Member, he labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to make me as odious as he can to the world, and to the State, and at the time of <hi>Lilbornes</hi> ≈øad ≈øentence, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth me in chiefe, with him and divers others in general in his Pamphlet to the Parliament, with fal≈øene≈ø≈øe, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold calumniations, corrupt practi≈øes, unju≈øt dealings, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, fraud, ambition, covetou≈ønes, and ≈øelfe-≈øeeking, and unju≈øt Levelling; and though he chargeth divers others with me, yet he hath not named them, no more doth he come to particulars to ≈øhew wherein we are as he charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us. And truly though I hope well for my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, yet I beleeve for my ≈øelfe: And if I thought it expedient to Vindicate my ≈øelfe from the title of Level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, I would tell this fal≈øe Accu≈øer, that if I am a Level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, I am no Leveller of the Vallies, but a Leveller of the <hi>MOUNTAINS,</hi> that the way of Je≈øus Chri≈øt may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, <hi>that all fle≈øh may ≈øee the ≈øalvation of our God,</hi> and this was the de≈øigne of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Bapti≈øt,</hi> and I hope no hone≈øt man will be offended with me for this manner of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117368:5"/>Levelling, nor account it unju≈øt, But <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Bapti≈øt</hi> gladly, but at la≈øt he cut off his head, and ≈øo he levelled the hone≈øt Leveller. Moreover I am ≈øo far from levelling the Lawes, That if the Parliament would put in practice their Legi≈ølative power, and ca≈øt a≈øide all the Lawes of the Land, the Lawes excepted which they have no power to aboli≈øh, and yeeld obedience to tho≈øe good Laws and none but ≈øuch, they may ≈øit long enough for me, I would not be forward to ≈øeek a new Repre≈øenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but a true Repre≈øentative; But oh!

            <p>And now I mu≈øt ≈øay this on the behalfe of Lieu. Col.
<note place="margin">Chidley's charity to Lilburn.</note> 
               <hi>Lilburn,</hi> that what≈øoever the matter is now, unle≈ø≈øe he bee much altered from what he was, his nature is ≈øo good that hee is not a man given to complaine, but where the ≈øhooe wringeth him; if men will let him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, he will let them alone, and in his dealings in the world he hath been very punctuall, neither can I tax him with any corrupt practi≈øes, or unju≈øt dealings, I have found him a plain, blunt, down right hone≈øt man; he wil play above board, and he that playeth with him ≈øhall have faire quarter: He is not of ≈øuch a revengefull ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to take his Adver≈øarie at advantages, and when he is down and at the weake≈øt to tread upon him: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ambition, doubtle≈ø≈øe, he hath ≈øeemed to me as if he were prodigall of his owne life, and blood, and ≈øtrength, and liberty, and all that was dear to him for the good of this Commonwealth: He was an in≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under God, that kept the Parliament from imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate de≈øtruction, for he defended them with his ≈øword from <hi>Lunsfords</hi> Crew,
<note place="margin">Lilburnes ambition.</note> ≈øo it ≈øeems to me all along as if he had been ambitious for Knocks, for a Pri≈øon, a Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Pillory, a Whip, a Gagge, yea, and death it ≈øelfe, and yet he is alive at this day, though he hath ≈øought to loo≈øe it, yet hath he found it: And touching covetou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, I hope he is free, I have known him to be liberall, and to be willing to ≈øpend and be ≈øpent for others when he hath wanted it him≈øelf, and I am ≈øure he is no Churle, but ready to do good to his ability; And had he been as Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> chargeth him, a Selfe-Seeker, crafty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, he might have feathered his ne≈øt ten times better then he hath done, but he was like a candle lighted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating others, and con≈øuming him≈øelf: Yea, hee who declareth him≈øelfe in Print again≈øt <hi>Lilburn,</hi> hath
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117368:6"/>received of him divers great ≈øums of money, but <hi>Lilburn</hi> complained that he could not get <hi>Brown</hi> to come to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with him, though he often de≈øired it, ≈øo fal≈øe was he to him, as he was to the poore of our Church, and I know not that he hath preferred any of us to any e≈øtate, much le≈ø≈øe a great e≈øtate, as he braggeth.</p>
            <p>Indeed once I imployed him to copy out a Letter, becau≈øe it ≈øhould be in his hand-writing, and not in mine, and an ordinary Scrivener would have done it for ≈øix pence, but I thought it was better to imploy a brother in fellow≈øhip, then a ≈øtranger to write for me, and the truth is, I have done him no wrong, unle≈ø≈øe it were dropping in his hands peeces of gold &amp; ≈øilver, which wrong he could, and did pocket up, and I could never get it to this day; no more could my mother get hers, which he came in a deceitfull way, and borrowed, and never paid, and it may be ≈øhee is the woman he ≈øpeakes of in his Pamphlet, though he chargeth her with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and if ≈øo, I mu≈øt ≈øay that ≈øhe hath done more good for the Commonwealth in one quarter of a yeare, then he hath done, or, it may be, will doe all his life time, for God hath made her an in≈øtrument to de≈øtroy the Forelorne hope, and totally to rout all the forces of Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> that great Champion for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as may appeare by her workes extant in Print.</p>
            <p>And concerning Mr. <hi>MUSGRAVE,</hi> he is knowne to be a very hone≈øt Gentleman, and one that was an Agent for his County, and performed his tru≈øt with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and faithfulne≈ø≈øe, and ≈øtood to his tacklings to the la≈øt, and though he were impri≈øoned wrongfully, in due time God relea≈øed him by meanes of the Army, when they came to <hi>London.</hi> The man is a man of good parts, having been bred up in the Law from his youth,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117368:6"/>and al≈øo he is ver≈øed in the Scripture, which is be≈øt of all; and had he but the abilities of <hi>Lilburne</hi> in expre≈ø≈øing him≈øelfe, and that ≈øtrength of memory withall, hee would confound the Lawyers. But indeed, I have thought him ≈øomewhat too har≈øh to the Parliament men, and thought that if he dealt more mildly with them, and with more humility, his words would bee more acceptable unto them; but I have knowne it a frequent thing with him when I have walked with him in the ≈øtreets, he would make no more to reprove a Parliament man, or an Officer of the Army, then I would of reproving my ≈øervant.</p>
            <p>As concerning the re≈øt of the per≈øons whom Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> inveighes again≈øt, though he name no man, yet I partly gue≈ø≈øe whom he meanes, and what it is that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øta≈øtes him, becau≈øe that they would not give him money for printing the whim≈øes of his owne braine, and ≈øuch crotchets as they were a≈øhamed of. Indeed if he had kept to their rules, and directions, and printed nothing, nor no more of a ≈øort then they gave him order to print, nor foy≈øted in his own tedious ≈øtuffe to the di≈øpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of that party of which he was a wi≈øe one, in his owne conceit, then he might have expected wages for his work. But when LIEU.

            <p>And as touching the private contributions, the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øer ≈øpeakes of charging me to be their Trea≈øurer, I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did unju≈øtly di≈øpo≈øe thereof, nor inrich my ≈øelfe thereby, but am out of pur≈øe, and had I the money in

The Title was THE SUPREAME AUTHORITY, and at that time, THE PARLIAMENT owned THE KING, and HOUSE OF LORDS, and were di≈øta≈øted at ≈øuch as ≈øtiled them, The Supream Authority, as ≈øavouring of levelling, yet notwith≈øtanding I was committed to the Gate-hou≈øe, but afterwards when the Army had conquered the King and his party, purged the Hou≈øe, and owned THE PARLIAMENT for the SUPREAM AUTHORITY, and that the Hou≈øe of Commons threw downe the Hou≈øe of Lords, then I knew that they were the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority, and have owned them ever ≈øince, and have done them faithfull ≈øervice, and offices of love in endeavouring to make reconciliation betwixt party and party; and to per≈øwade them that they may ≈øit downe quietly under this pre≈øent Government, and it is well knowne what paines and labour I be≈øtowed to make a hand≈øome compo≈øure, and I did not altogether faile of my de≈øires and expectation. But in this bu≈øines of Sir. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur He≈øleriges</hi> I medled not having had matters of more

            <p>Whereas the accu≈øer ≈øaith, that Printing hath beene our chiefe≈øt weapon, and by that occa≈øion, that wee have great corre≈øpondency with Printers, and ≈øome of us ready to print what we plea≈øe again≈øt them.</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer, that my judgement is not for printing of here≈øie or bla≈øphemy, or matter of ≈øcandall, or a lye, but onely the truth, and I hold it one of the greate≈øt abu≈øes of the Commonwealth, that ≈øo many lying foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh Pamphlets have been, and are ≈øuffered to go abroad; ≈øurely the Printers have much to an≈øwer for at the day of judgement, ≈øeeing for every idle word which a man ≈øhall ≈øpeak, he mu≈øt an≈øwer for at the day of Judgement, ≈øo farre am I from holding a corre≈øpondence with them, that I pronounce the judgements of God again≈øt them, ≈øaying, Woe unto you Printers, for you have much to an≈øwer for: I have been more carefull what I print, then what I write or ≈øpeak, becau≈øe if a man print an Impre≈ø≈øion of fifteen hundred books, peradventure they may be ≈øpread to 15000. per≈øons, and leven them all, and its (in a maner) impo≈ø≈øible to recal them; Now who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever readeth the la≈øt lea≈øe of this our Accu≈øers Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, will have occa≈øion to think the man not to bee of very deep judgement, for though the Pre≈ø≈øe is free for all men both knaves and fooles, as well as wi≈øe men, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they put their names to it, and the Printer his name, which is too large a latitude (as I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) Yet our Accu≈øer would have the Parliaments order to print again≈øt us, and layeth downe a po≈øitive Law, as if he and his family were a high Commi≈ø≈øion; or Spani≈øh Inqui≈øition, yea and wor≈øe; <hi>viz.</hi> that what≈øoever

            <p>But above all per≈øons, this Accu≈øer hath a great fling at me, and yet his ≈øling-≈øtones are but as ≈øtubble, but his madne≈ø≈øe is becau≈øe he was ca≈øt out of the Church, as may appear by his Pamphlet; herein he acteth the Dragons part, who was exceeding wrath after hee ≈øaw he was ca≈øt out of Heaven, and therefore though the Heavens are called to rejoyce, yet a woe is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the Earth and the Inhabitants thereof, <hi>For the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill is come downe unto you, having great wrath, becau≈øe he knoweth he hath but a ≈øhort time.</hi>

               <p>But becau≈øe many who know not what the power of godline≈ø≈øe is, will count me too captious and curious, and always finding fault, will ≈øay, I have ≈øome exceptions again≈øt the new Debenters, delivered from this Office, I an≈øwer, that ≈øetting the idolatrous impre≈ø≈øions in the Seals a ≈øide, I have none at all, unle≈ø≈øe it bee the Printers mi≈øtake in ≈øome part of them, omiting a word, and putting the year of <hi>our Lord</hi> 1651. in≈øtead of the year of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> 1651. For in humility it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that this word [our Lord] is too high and too holy for all to whom the new Debenters do belong: For it is que≈øtionable, whether they have an intere≈øt in the Lord, whom they cal their Lord, but rather many of them are of their Father the Devill, who≈øe works they do; yet they have their portion in this life; and in equity, what is due upon Debenters, mu≈øt be paid off to the Originall Creditors, as the <hi>States Servants,</hi> and not as the <hi>Lords Servants</hi> without a vi≈øible demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtration thereof; for a beleeving Ma≈øter may have an unbeleeving Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and he is not to oppre≈ø≈øe him by keeping backe his wages, for that is a cur≈øed thing; and it is the note of a wicked man, to borrow and not to pay, but righteous men are mercifull men, and ≈øo full of rationality as to love their enemies, to ble≈ø≈øe them that cur≈øe them, to pray for them that per≈øecute them and di≈øpightfully u≈øe them, and to owe nothing to any man, but love: If Chri≈øtians owe any thing to a Heathen, or a Jew, or any other who acknowledgeth not Chri≈øt to be his Lord, yet I ≈øee no rea≈øon, that that Jew, Heathen or Unbeleever ≈øhould be deprived of his right by any man what≈øoever.</p>
               <p>Yet I could wi≈øh that this whole Army might expell their dro≈ø≈øe. and in re≈øpect of ≈øanctification be made as white as ≈ønow in <hi>Salmon,</hi> then we might well expect the Almighty to ≈øcatter Kings by it, their
